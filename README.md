# sql-business-insights-portfolio

This repository showcases SQL projects I developed to extract insights from real-world datasets.  
The case studies demonstrate how SQL queries can be applied to identify trends, monitor performance, and support data-driven decision-making.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Ford GoBike (2014–2017)
**Objective:** Analyze trip data to uncover demand patterns and resource utilization.  
- Identified seasonal downturns (Nov–Dec) and mid-2017 growth surge.  
- Found that ~90% of trips were concentrated in San Francisco, but Emeryville stations were under-utilized.  
- Detected resource imbalance (trips vs. bike availability).

**Files:**  
- `ford_gobike/ford_gobike_analysis.sql` → SQL queries  
- `ford_gobike/insights.md` → summary of findings

### 2. Hacker News Retention
**Objective:** Evaluate user retention and churn dynamics.  
- Cohort analysis revealed only ~14.55% of new users return the following month.  
- High churn (~85%) after first visit indicates weak onboarding and engagement.

**Files:**  
- `hacker_news/hacker_news_retention.sql` → SQL queries  
- `hacker_news/insights.md` → summary of findings
